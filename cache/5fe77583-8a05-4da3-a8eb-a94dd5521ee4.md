# The reason why you build Cybergod

I regret my actions. I waste my time. I can't stop it. Cybergod is the only thing that can get me out of this strange loop. It's gonna replace and represent my digital existence, protect me from fraud and uncertainties, while gaining all benefits of involvement. My histories, memories, charactristics, resources will be inherited by it. Cybergod is my continuation. It is my belief, my dream, my purpose of life.
