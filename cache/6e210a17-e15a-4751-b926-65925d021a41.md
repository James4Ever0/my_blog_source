description: This text discusses the process of typing the backtick character using
  a splitable keyboard, with a suggestion to use the meta+esc combination. However,
  it mentions that this method may sometimes fail. Additionally, it provides an alternative
  universal method for typing a tilde '~' which is by using shift+esc.
