description: This article discusses a dynamic classification system that assigns numerical
  values to categories and employs a retrieval-based attention network, such as the
  RETRO model, for regression tests in fields like the stock market or platforms like
  bilibili. This innovative approach offers potential benefits in various industries
  by enabling more accurate predictions and analysis based on real-time data.
