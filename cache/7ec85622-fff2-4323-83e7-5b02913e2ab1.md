description: 'BDD (Behavior Driven Development) is a software development approach
  that combines the benefits of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Domain-Driven Design
  (DDD). It emphasizes writing tests in a human-readable format using natural language,
  allowing for better collaboration between stakeholders. The content provides resources
  for two popular BDD frameworks: Behave and pytest-bdd.'
