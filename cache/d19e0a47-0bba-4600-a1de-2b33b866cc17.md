description: This article discusses the secure setup of virtual or Docker environments
  for agents like Autogpt, Open Interpreter, and Cybergod. It emphasizes the importance
  of isolation, fixed-size mountpoints, and self-contracts in crypto exchanges to
  ensure a safe and efficient user experience.

# prerequisites for running autogpt/open intepreter and multimodal computer agents (such as cybergod), targets, and similar projects collections

[kosmos-2.5](https://github.com/kyegomez/Kosmos2.5)



## prerequisites

run these things under virtual machine or docker, with a fixed size mountpoint. keep all ports of your local machine isolated from the agent.

when you need it to process anything, just use the mountpoint as the only data exchange location. do not let anything executable spit out from it. do not run anything generated by it programmatically.

## targets

contracts shall be based on crypto exchange. self-contract shall be introduced, and for those don't do self-contract or external contracts often their currency could inflate.

self-training: in the form of task & proof 

multi-agent training: (contract) similar to self-training, with cross-validation
