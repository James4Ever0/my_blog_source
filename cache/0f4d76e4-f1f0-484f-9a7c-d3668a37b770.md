description: slowmoVideo is a software that leverages GPU and optical flow technology
  to generate slow-motion effects by interpolating frames. With clear optical flow
  boundaries, it can also potentially support instance segmentation. To utilize CUDA
  support, OpenCV must be built with opencv_contrib and -DWITH_CUDA=ON.

# Optical Flow, slow motion and more

https://github.com/slowmoVideo/slowmoVideo

it uses gpu and optical flow to do frame interpolation.

able to do instance segmentation if the optical flow boundary is clear and continuous.

build opencv with opencv_contrib and -DWITH_CUDA=ON to enable cudaoptflow.
