description: This article addresses the challenges faced while using AMDGPU, ROCM,
  and PyTorch. It proposes alternative solutions such as Vulkan/OpenGL or DirectML
  for integrated graphics cards instead of ROCM, and advises checking the Pytorch
  nightly repo for up-to-date builds.

# amdgpu, rocm and pytorch

rocm is trash to apu. use vulkan or opengl (alternative backends)

---

find latest build in pytorch nightly repo

use sudo before invoking amdgpu related commands, otherwise unavailable

---

use directml (pytorch, tensorflow) instead. need windows.

you need to set the shared graphical memory to a larger value.

rocm does not work for integrated graphic cards (even if you build it and configured the card name), and supported amd cards are limited.
