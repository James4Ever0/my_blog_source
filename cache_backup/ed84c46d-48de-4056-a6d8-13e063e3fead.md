# Attractive Dynamic plus attractive video

Some contents are viral to the users. Will add extra watches if combined with related video or essay.

May apply the same rule to other platforms. Must select those with largest views, or verified by trained grading models. Native language only, or we have to translate and verify/convey it into native form. Post it to QQ, other platforms in the form of pictures, links.
