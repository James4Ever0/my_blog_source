# Emotion manipulation

Predict emotion by means of graphics, motion, text, voice and swap context to achieve desirable effects.
Add random swap and funny pictures in addition to simple dictation.
You may group different kinds of content for specialized model training.
Syncing is hard. With database, it's not.

Analyze the conversation with emotional/keyword frequency indicator, do some feature extraction.
Accelerate part of the video to be more expressive
