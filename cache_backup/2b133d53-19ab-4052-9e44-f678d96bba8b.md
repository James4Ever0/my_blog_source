# macbook air usage notes

## notes on macbook air

this damn thing sucks, in every aspect. i am getting tired of it.

## the body position of using this thing

raise my legs with multiple pillows, put this thing on my hip and lean on a triangular shaped pile of pillows.

still not ideal but pretty close. in order to make this laptop not sliping down my hip i need to fill the gap between laptop and my belly with clothes. need to support my arms with some toys.
