description: This article explores the concepts of rectangle packing and polygon to
  rectangle decomposition. Rectangle packing involves fitting rectangles into a given
  space, while polygon decomposition focuses on breaking down a polygon into rectangles.
  These techniques can be applied in various fields like computer graphics, robotics,
  and manufacturing optimization.
