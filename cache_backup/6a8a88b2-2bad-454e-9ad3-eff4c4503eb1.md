description: This article discusses image and cloth classification using advanced
  models such as vit-pytorch and a feed forward neural network. The vit-pytorch model
  employs multiple attention heads for efficient image classification, while the feed
  forward neural network is specifically designed for cloth classification. Both models
  can be found on their respective GitHub repositories.
