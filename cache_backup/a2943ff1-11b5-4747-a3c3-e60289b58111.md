description: This article delves into the integration of FastAPI, Celery, and task
  queues with web sockets. It covers various topics like resolving Jinja2 whitespace
  issues, working with uvicorn import, utilizing openapi.json client code generation
  for documentation purposes, adding metadata to enhance docs, and sharing locks across
  multiple processes. Additionally, it provides useful resources for advanced usage.

# fastapi, celery, task queue, websocket

enable render option `trim_blocks` and `lstrip_blocks` with `jinja2` to avoid whitespace and indentation nightmare.

----

always remember to import `uvicorn` if you want to run without the `uvicorn` executable

----

generate [nodejs client](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/) from `openapi.json`

[fastapi-code-generator](https://pypi.org/project/fastapi-code-generator/) to generate python code

----

create doc inside code: [adding metadata](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/metadata/)

----

to share lock across process, use [redis lock](https://pypi.org/project/python-redis-lock/) or filelock.

to share lock across forked process in the same worker, use `multiprocessing.Lock()`

----

fastapi can generate openapi json and doc page

websockets are async. will it block the server?
