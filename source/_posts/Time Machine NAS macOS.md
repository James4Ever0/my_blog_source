# Time Machine NAS macOS

use rclone to periodically commit files to NAS (incremental only, do not delete things), or use rclone to copy files to external SSD

buy airport extreme as wireless router and backup device

----

when in doubt, delete files under GUI instead of terminal

check out commands for moving files into trash bin instead of direct removal on different OSes

----

my data under `~/works` is lost. fuck.

buy me some ssd 512GB at least to do time machine backup.

buy m.2 ssd to reduce the size.

use usb-c cables to prevent inconvenience.

----

the filesystem will be formatted as APFS.

need a dedicated usb storage for it.

do not know if it is incremental backup.
