logic: if the kill switch is off, when no physical input events happens, or not focused on scrcpy window with keyboard/mouse input events on pc for some time, allow to interact with the phone.

get physical events:

warning: this command could be offline for a short period of time after using the scrcpy. must automatically reconnect if the device is not offline.

```bash
adb -s 192.168.10.3:5555 shell getevent
```

to get focused window title:
hint: for headless ssh sessions, must set apropriate xorg environment variables, eg: `env XAUTHORITY="/run/user/0/gdm/Xauthority" DISPLAY=:1 python3`

general method:
```python
import pywinctl
pywinctl.getActiveWindowTitle()
```

for linux:
```bash
watch -n 2 xdotool getactivewindow getwindowname
```

for macos: (allow permission first, deprecated since it will not get the window title instead of the program name)
https://alvinalexander.com/mac-os-x/applescript-unix-mac-osx-foreground-application-result/
(where is the window name?)
```bash
sleep 3 && osascript -e 'tell application "System Events"' -e 'set frontApp to name of first application process whose frontmost is true' -e 'end tell'
```


to get input events on macos:
download keylogger here:

https://github.com/beatsbears/pkl?ref=hackernoon.com
```bash
python pkl_nowriting.py
```

input events on linux:

```bash
xinput test-xi2 --root
```
