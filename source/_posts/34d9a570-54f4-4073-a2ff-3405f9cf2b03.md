use `tensorly` to create random sparse tensor and eye sparse tensor with ease, which could be numpy only, and requires the `sparse` package.

`scipy`, `pytorch`, `tensorflow`, `jax` all support sparse tensor construction but advanced apis are not.

use `eye` to create bias and input matrix, extract node values. use random sparse tensor to initialize weight matrix. use self matrix multiplication to perform propagation.

the human brain has roughly 87 billion neurons, and every one of them has thousands of synapses.

```python
import torch
large_number = 1_000_000
torch.arange(large_number).unsqueeze(0).repeat(2, 1)
index_arr = torch.arange(large_number).unsqueeze(0).repeat(2, 1)
val_arr = torch.ones(large_number)
sparse_eye = torch.sparse_coo_tensor(index_arr, val_arr, (large_number, large_number))
# sparse_eye.to('cuda')

```

alternatively:
```python
import torch
import tensorly.contrib.sparse as tsl_sp
large_number = 1_000_000
numpy_eye = tsl_sp.eye(large_number)
torch_eye = torch.sparse_coo_tensor(numpy_eye.coords, numpy_eye.data, numpy_eye.shape)

```
