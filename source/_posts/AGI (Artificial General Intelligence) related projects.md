# AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) related projects

said by [HTM](https://github.com/numenta/nupic.torch), AGI knows what it did to the world (self-awareness), also signals from sensors.

## [google research](https://github.com/google-research/google-research)

gwern wrote a [fiction](https://www.gwern.net/fiction/Clippy). he thinks agi starts from [automl-zero](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/automl_zero) which is similar to [lazero](https://github.com/James4Ever0/lazero) and [metalazero](https://gitee.com/x00e0d991e368/metalazero) by name and perspective.

by design lazero can be deeply aligned, inspecting and studying user's actions. it also has its own exploration space. however, these expectations can never be fully satisfied at the same time. if you want more power, you have to let go.

## [lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains?tab=repositories) repositories

this one got lots of state-of-the-art implementations for close-sourced papers and also repos for AGI. stunning.
