# opentimelineio: unified format for media editors?

similar language like mine is named as "medialang", with very stupid syntax (thus might limit expressiveness) and lacks visualization tool.

it offers many adapters for final cut pro, adobe premiere, kdenlive and more.

it has simple python interface.

but! many adapters are incomplete right now.

limited [otio mlt adapter](https://pypi.org/project/otio-mlt-adapter/)
