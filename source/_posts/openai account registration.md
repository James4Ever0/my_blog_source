# openai account registration

according to [this tutorial](https://www.modb.pro/db/573022), openai does not accept chinese phone numbers, you should use numbers from india rented on [sms-activate](https://sms-activate.org/) (which uses [pockyt.io](https://pockyt.io/) to bridge alipay). you use temporary edu mail like [tempumail](https://tempumail.com/mailbox) instead of your own email to prevent issues.
