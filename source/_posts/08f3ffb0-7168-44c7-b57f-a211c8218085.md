[trash-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/trash) (with [python binding](https://github.com/sindresorhus/trash-cli)) may work cross-platform, but manage its own recycle bin instead of the system if using windows or macos.

[empty-trash-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/empty-trash-cli)

## windows

[cmdutils](http://www.maddogsw.com/cmdutils/) which has `recycle` and `bin` commands

[cmd-recycle](https://github.com/kizzx2/cmd-recycle/)

[nircmd](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html)
```cmd
nircmd moverecyclebin *.tmp

```

## macos

do this manually:
```bash
# i don't trust this.
#rm -rf ~/.Trash/*
osascript -e 'tell app "Finder" to empty'

```
