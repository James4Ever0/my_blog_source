description: This article explores Python testing methods, logging best practices,
  and error handling techniques. It also introduces alternative libraries, such as
  enum class, pytest caching, Redis LRU cache for decorators, build tools, type checking,
  code static analysis, automation tools like pydoit, SCons, and Rake. The article
  aims to provide insights into various Python tools and their applications for effective
  development and maintenance.

# Incremental testing, build tools, cacheing, logging

how to log error emitted from `better-exceptions`?

----

logging tutorial at [betterstack](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/logging/python/python-logging-best-practices/) & [official](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html)

other logging libraries: [loguru](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/logging/loguru/) [structlog](https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/) (able to show locals/globals around error)

----

[better-exceptions](https://github.com/qix-/better-exceptions)

----

to ensure the consistency of tests, you need to collect input/output pairs (and compare with expected/actual output), if it is deterministic.

----

monkeytype, pytype (by google), runtype (Dispatch)

----

better assertion

----

[enum class](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/enum.html#enum-class-differences) in python

----

use [cache](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/cache.html) in pytest

use redis lru_cache, put decorators to json serializable functions

use build tools, forcing program to read and write files in the process

type checking using mypy

code static analysis

code formatter like black

----

tools:

[pydoit](https://pydoit.org/dependencies.html) with "up to date" signals for non-file objectives

[scons](https://scons.org/doc/production/HTML/scons-user.html#idp105549032593992)

ruby [rake](https://graceful.dev/courses/the-freebies/modules/rake-and-project-automation/topic/episode-131-rake-rules/)
