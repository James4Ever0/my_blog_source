# APFS for Linux

i use this adapter to transfer files (you know that) to kali.

read only support. if write then the filesystem will break.

[apfs-fuse](https://github.com/sgan81/apfs-fuse) read-only, single executable, no kernel module

[linux-apfs-rw](https://github.com/linux-apfs/linux-apfs-rw) kernel module, read/write support
