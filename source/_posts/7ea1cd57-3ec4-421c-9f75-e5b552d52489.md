description: Scribe.rip is a website that offers an unblocked version of restricted
  Medium articles without additional features like 'trending', 'user homepage', or
  'most read' sections. Instead of using `medium.com` links, it recommends replacing
  them with `scribe.rip`. The source code for hosting your own Scribe instance is
  also available on Sourcehunt.

# Medium Subscription Bypass

this site only unblock "restricted" articles. it does not offer "trending" "user homepage" "most read" "recommendation" things which you can get from official medium website.

map `*.medium.com/[URL]` to `scribe.rip/[URL]`

or try to host `scribe.rip` yourself.

[source code](https://git.sr.ht/~edwardloveall/scribe) hosted on [sourcehunt](https://sr.ht).

[alternative scribe instances](https://git.sr.ht/~edwardloveall/scribe/tree/main/item/docs/instances.md) seems all blocked (in mainland)
