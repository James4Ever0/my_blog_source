# Video delogo/inpainting

propainter remove watermark with tracking, entity segmentation

you can use [clip](https://github.com/LAION-AI/LAION-5B-WatermarkDetection) for watermark detection, but you don't know where. fuck. you better train it yourself.

[watermark detection model](https://wandb.ai/arkseal/laion-watermark-detection/artifacts/model/model/f88165bb9d2cbccc51b5)

```python
import timm
# all other pytorch imports
# Not used but necessary when running on images
transforms = T.Compose([
T.Resize((256, 256)),
T.ToTensor(),
T.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])
# Create model
model = timm.create_model('efficientnet_b3a', pretrained=False, num_classes=2)
model.classifier = nn.Sequential(
nn.Linear(in_features=1536, out_features=625),
nn.ReLU(),
nn.Dropout(p=0.3),
nn.Linear(in_features=625, out_features=256),
nn.ReLU(),
nn.Linear(in_features=256, out_features=2)
)
# Load model weights
state_dict = torch.load('./model.pt')
model.load_state_dict(state_dict).eval().to(device)
# Sample Image
im = torch.randn(8, 3, 256, 256)
with torch.no_grad():
pred = model(im)
syms = F.softmax(pred, dim=1).detach().cpu().numpy().tolist()
for water_sym, clear_sym in syms:
# Do whatever you want with the watermark simlarity

```

## image local contrast enhancement, for removing hard-to-detect watermarks

maybe you can use the same trick (context preserving sliding window) from your search engine to here (image preprocessing)!
