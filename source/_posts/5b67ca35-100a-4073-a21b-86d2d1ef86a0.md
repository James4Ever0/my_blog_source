description: This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to upload a model to
  Hugging Face's Hub using code. It includes a link for detailed instructions and
  demonstrates the process with the Camembert language model, utilizing AutoModelForMaskedLM
  and AutoTokenizer from Transformers library. The model and tokenizer are then pushed
  to the Hub under the name 'dummy-model'.

# Upload Model To Huggingface

via code:
 https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/390826470

from transformers import AutoModelForMaskedLM, AutoTokenizer

checkpoint = "camembert-base"

model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)

model.push_to_hub("dummy-model")
tokenizer.push_to_hub("dummy-model")
# config.push_to_hub("<model_name>")
