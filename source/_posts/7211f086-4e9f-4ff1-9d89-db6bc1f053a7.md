still don't forgive that damn [cacani](https://cacani.sg/) software ([manual](https://cacani.sg/CACANi_manual.pdf?v=1c2903397d88)), and i still don't find a clue for creating animation with cacani automatically.

search for "themida unpacker" or "unlicense" in bing or github. saying manually unpacking themida is always a pain in the ass.
