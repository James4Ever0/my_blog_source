description: This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to reset a Windows
  Server password when it cannot be fixed by `chntpw`. The process involves swapping
  `Utilman.exe` with `cmd.exe`, accessing the command prompt through widgets, and
  using the `net user` command to reset the password.

# reset windows server password

`chntpw` does not work this time. it will auto restore 
the SAM file.

instead, under directory `C:\Windows\System32`, swap `Utilman.exe` (remember to back it up) with `cmd.exe` then click widgets in login window to popup command prompt, type `net user <username> <password>` to reset.
