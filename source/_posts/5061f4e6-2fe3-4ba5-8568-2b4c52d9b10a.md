to speed up `numpy` performance, either use multicore enabled BLAS library, intel MKL or use `cupy` (ROCm ready)

to check if `numpy` is not using multicore, run:

```python
import numpy as np
size = 10000
a = np.random.random_sample((size, size))
b = np.random.random_sample((size, size))
n = np.dot(a,b) # run for a long time

```

use `scipy.optimize`
