there are some code in his repo about scraping proxies. running this on kaggle or github ci providers.

on github search for "clash" "ssr" "proxy" "shadowsocks" "v2ray" "fanqiang" or some keywords obvious to you then sort by "recently updated" since available proxy pool will be constantly updated.

or you could use lantern.

## sources

### [proxyscan.io](https://www.proxyscan.io/api)

referred by [Proxy-List](https://github.com/ShiftyTR/Proxy-List)

### telegram bots

[high quality proxy (channel)](https://t.me/HQPROX)

[socks5 bot](https://t.me/socks5_bot)

### self-hosted or cloud/CI based

[proxylist](https://github.com/fate0/proxylist) by fate0 (ceased contribution for long) has stopped working since broken github action settings, though [getproxy](https://github.com/fate0/getproxy) still works (collecting unchecked proxies via travis-ci). i think clash can handle that automatically though.
