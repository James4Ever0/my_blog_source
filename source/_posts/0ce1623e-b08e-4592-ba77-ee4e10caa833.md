## linux
[cpufrequtils](http://kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/cpufreq/cpufrequtils.html)
[throttling cpu frequencies by temperature incrementally](https://github.com/Sepero/temp-throttle)
the desired temperature is 60.
usually when one throttles the CPU temperature, the GPU cannot be overheated.
it is turning my core i7 into a pentium 3! but not entirely cumbersome.
