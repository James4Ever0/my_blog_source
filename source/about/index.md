Hi there, I am James Brown, an independent researcher of Artificial General Intelligence.

Okay, I know you have a bunch of questions about me, especially about the blog I made up. I think there are lots of ideas that I have to note down, and I think even those ideas are not represented in fluent words, still valuable in the long run.

I am a man of history. I kept my browsing history, bash history, historical files and code, favourites, chat history and more. I think this is what I made of, and I will use that as initial resources for my superintelligence.

Back to business. What can you learn from me? What benefits could you have by reading my blogs? I have been doing a lot of researches in many different areas, and I am trying my best to put them together and maximize profit. I think it is important to understand the world by helping others to understand as well.

I started by writing AI generated documents, using AI to explain my discoveries and eventually recursively finding useful information in this haystack of information. I am immersed in thoughts, and I am determined to achieve what I have thought for. I believe it will help my research and help others understand this beautiful world a little more deeper, by thinking and doing in a way that never happens before.
