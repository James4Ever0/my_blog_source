# CPU Overheating (temperature too high)

## linux

[cpufrequtils](http://kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/cpufreq/cpufrequtils.html)

[throttling cpu frequencies by temperature incrementally](https://github.com/Sepero/temp-throttle)

the desired temperature is 60.

usually when one throttles the CPU temperature, the GPU cannot be overheated.

it is turning my core i7 into a pentium 3! but not entirely cumbersome.
