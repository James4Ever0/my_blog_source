# RL, trajectory prediction, model predictive control

this reminds me of `ddpg-usv-asmc` and [Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms-with-PyTorch](https://github.com/p-christ/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms-with-PyTorch) (is it? nope. it is [stable-baseline3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3), containing [PPO](https://openai.com/blog/openai-baselines-ppo/) preferred by OpenAI when training InstructGPT) or [Deep-reinforcement-learning-with-pytorch](https://github.com/sweetice/Deep-reinforcement-learning-with-pytorch)
