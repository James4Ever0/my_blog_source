# comprehensive page dump from multiple devices

i said taking notes manually is always a bad idea if you can just do it with LLM. since web browsing is just like playing video games

to get latest [personal news](https://blog.feeds.pub/github-rss.html) (like `https://github.com/James4Ever0.private.atom?token=<token>`), [trends](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub) from github, use some rss feeds.

to monitor discord channels, monitor QQ chats, wechat messages and filter links out of it.

to dump pages and clipboards from devices, which is what we are trying to do.

----

better keep it tight. when doing so, you want to make it is absolutely private. nothing is public.

you can use a filter or something. you can also just keep it discrete.

## Webpage dumps

use "bookmark all tabs" or "copy all tab urls" browser extension, or your OG [lazero extension](https://gitee.com/x00e0d991e368/metalazero/tree/master/browser_plugin)

### macOS

check for "Comprehensive Research" series

----

you can only bookmark all tabs and tab groups within a single window.

for example, if you have two windows open, you need to do it twice to save all links to your computer.

### Kali

check "Healthcare and Watch Cases" under firefox bookmarks.

### Android

to install a plugin on kiwi browser, you (maybe) need to unpack and install it manually.

you need chrome extension v3 or below. pack the extension manually if needed. must install from .crx file.

query: `site:github.com chrome copy all tabs`

use [this](https://github.com/georgemandis/copy-open-tabs-urls) or [this](https://github.com/charlesbrandt/copy_all_tabs) or [this](https://github.com/teddywing/chrome-copy-urls-from-all-tabs).

if you want markdown-style, use [this](https://github.com/yorkxin/copy-as-markdown) or [this](https://github.com/JannesMeyer/TabAttack) or [this](https://github.com/tsushiy/copy-tabs-as-markdown) (you need to modify this as it is the only hope now) or [this](https://github.com/zaki-yama/copy-title-and-url-as-markdown). query: `site:github.com chrome copy all tabs markdown`.

you click every tab manually, in order to copy them. goddamn the android!

----

for firefox, you search in the official addon store.

clipboard data and tab records dumped at `~/works/modifier_clipboard_and_browser_tabs_dumps`

remember to clean up the damn phone. it is running way too slow.
