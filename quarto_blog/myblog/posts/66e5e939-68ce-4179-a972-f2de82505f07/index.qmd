# what is causing my mac to freeze when kali is offline

modified scripts:

`/Users/jamesbrown/Desktop/works/host_discovery_ssh_local_connect/load_tuntap_launch_n2n_kali_root.sh`

`/Users/jamesbrown/Desktop/works/host_discovery_ssh_local_connect/nginx_with_kali_finder.sh`

`/Library/Application Support/ZeroTier/One/launch.sh`

seems zerotier one is the main cause!
