# MacOS mount ntfs volumes

macos mount ntfs read-only by default.

code from [mounty.app](https://mounty.app/)

mounty is somehow not working so manual remount is needed.

one needs to click the remount button to mount it again under `/Users/jamesbrown/.mounty/Toshiba3000`

```bash
sudo umount /Volumes/Toshiba3000
sudo mkdir /Volumes/Toshiba3000; sudo mount -t ntfs -o rw,auto,nobrowse /dev/<diskIdentifier> /Volumes/Toshiba3000
```
