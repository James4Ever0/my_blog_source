# commandline json/html filter and formatters

for hackers, filtering matters.

[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

[jqterm](https://jqterm.com/?query=.) online jq repl

[htmlq](https://github.com/mgdm/htmlq) is for querying html with selectors, extracting text from html

[pup](https://github.com/ericchiang/pup) download from [release](https://github.com/EricChiang/pup/releases/tag/v0.4.0)

one must collect a handful set of regular expression/filters to do hacking

searching, regex, two most important things for hackers. it's not about blindly collecting data. it's power and knowledge.
