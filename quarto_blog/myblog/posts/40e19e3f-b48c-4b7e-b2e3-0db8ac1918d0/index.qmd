------

# generate publickey again with rsa private key

not possible. use personal access token as password instead.

cause the deploy public key does not allow duplicate public key, causing trouble for us to use the git repo sync tool.

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/Users/jamesbrown/.notable/id_rsa_original_backup
PUBKEY_PATH=/Users/jamesbrown/.notable/id_rsa.pub2
ssh-keygen -y -f $PRIVATE_KEY_PATH > $PUBKEY_PATH
```
