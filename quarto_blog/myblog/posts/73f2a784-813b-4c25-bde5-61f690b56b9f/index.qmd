------
to increase stability, you need to prevent computer from overheating (throttle). also, replace normal laptop ram with ecc ram (not server-grade reg-ecc)
but ecc is only supported on Xeon processors.
moreover, you could just use UPS+NUC instead of laptop, to prevent this bloody battery issue.

will these charging limits still work if we close the lid? if not, we could possibly damage the battery.

to prevent damage to computer battery due to overcharging
## Linux
kernel 5.5 or newer:
```bash
echo 60 | sudo tee /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold
```
with [platform-specific drivers](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/48534/how-to-adjust-charging-thresholds-of-laptop-battery), look for: `/sys/devices/platform/.*/.*(battery|charge|thresh|limit).*`
For ThinkPads and selected other laptops [tlp](https://linrunner.de/tlp)/tlpui (acts like [powertop](https://01.org/powertop/) which turns off usb devices, so be careful when running long-term programs) provides a unified way
to configure charge thresholds and recalibrate the battery.
## Windows
