## Smart Watch

do not mix the water with the watch. you have been warned.

----

Prefer WearOS watches like LG W100. Found 3D printable case on Shapeways but not downloadable. Shapeways provides service for printing. Shapeways builds ShapeJS which can construct 3D models with code.

----

Use Pixle2Mesh++ to recover 3D meshes from multiple images (dumped at `~/Desktop/works/shapeways_reconstruct_from_image_lg_w100`)of different viewpoints. Determine the size of the mesh after measurement or learning specs.

----

if you want iwatch instead, remember to buy some apple gift cards for buying watchos apps. remember to ask for battery life since older watches tend to die halfway in a day. buy iphone 6s and newer models with ios 14 and newer os to manage and install apps on iwatch. no need for 3d modeling since plenty tough-tested cases around.

## DIY

if you want to do it on your own, you have to know how to send notifications on different operating systems.

----

on macOS:
```bash
osascript -e 'display notification "This message should be showing on the notification" with title "Coding Tips"'

```

[terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier) (brew installable)

[alerter](https://github.com/vjeantet/alerter)

----

on linux:
```bash
notify-send "Dinner ready!"

```

using `remind`:
```bash
remind "I'm still here" now
remind "Time to wake up!" in 5 minutes
remind "Dinner" in 1 hour
remind "Take a break" at noon
remind "It's Friday pints time!" at 17:00

```

----

on windows:
```cmd
msg /SERVER:DestinationPC * /TIME:60 â€œThis is the message to be sent to a PC named DestinationPC and closes in 60 seconds."

```
