# the formula search engine, latex enabled, textbook search engine

[latex2sympy](https://github.com/augustt198/latex2sympy) convert latex to sympy using antlr

[mathpix]() has stunning accuracy but is not free. they offer timely licensed docker images.

[im2markup]() is by far the most accurate one. it is attention based and can be trained on multiple markup languages.
