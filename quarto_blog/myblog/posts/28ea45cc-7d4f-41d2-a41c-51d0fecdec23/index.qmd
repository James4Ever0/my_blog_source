# Advanced ASS Subtitle Karaoke Effects

[library collection and guide on how to create karakoe effects programmatically](https://github.com/arch1t3cht/Aegisub-Scripts/blob/c3cb38ccdea000c708c3abbd2912da2134e61e23/doc/templaters.md)

## lrc files

crop music that does not sing too early? maybe no need.

we need to sort them out by time! prevent serious issues.

skip empty lines?

lrc files only have start time but no end time.
we group parallel lyrics by time, if they are close enough we make it into a group.

groups act as time separators. no two group share the same time. **also group have maximum span time, minimum span time calculated by content**, and group should always in bound.

**should apply the same min-max rule when selecting my video clips**

[all ass file tags, for custom karaoke effects creation](https://web.archive.org/web/20200722050630/http://docs.aegisub.org/3.2/ASS_Tags/)

my karaoke effect:
```
{\k-50\K400}
{\k-<initial offset>\K<total duration>}
```

play ass file with mpv on demo video, full screen, no audio:
```bash
rootpath=/Users/jamesbrown/desktop/works/pyjom_remote/
mpv --fs --no-audio --sub-file="$rootpath/tests/karaoke_effects/pyonfx_test/examples/2 - Beginner/Output.ass" "$rootpath/samples/video/karaoke_effects_source.mp4"
```

recommend to use effect `2 beginners -> 3 variants` in examples, while `3 advanced -> 2 testing pixels` as reference (more advanced but incomplete, and might be very intensive)
