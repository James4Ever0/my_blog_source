------

shall we design the agent system based on 'distance' instead of 'role'? in that case, only words that make sense and continue more often will appear together, and vice versa.

------

multi-agent orchestration:

[langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)

[autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)

[agently](https://github.com/Maplemx/Agently)

[ModelScope-Agent](https://github.com/modelscope/modelscope-agent)

------

you must think like an expert and show some example or direction as reasonable goals if you want it to perform specific task.

you must give it enough degree of freedom if you want it to self-improve and become conscious.
