------
when installing global ackages, we do not need to specify NODE_PATH. but it is not configured beforehand thus when you want to import packages from there you will face issue.
for zsh/bash/fish:
```bash
export NODE_PATH=<NODE_PATH>
```
on windows just use the old school drill (open environment editor)
chech the exact path of `NODE_PATH` after invoking `npm install -g <package_name>`, then check if the installed package exists in that path you guessed.
on termux: `/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/node_modules`
on kali: `/usr/local/lib/node_modules` (may be inaccurate)
on macos: `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules` (nodejs installed via brew)
