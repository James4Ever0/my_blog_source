------

you talk about planting virus in software when people need it, also sharing some encrypted porn/copyrighted material to users, or mining crypto through github ci, exploits. when doing so, make sure the money is **laundried**, either through transfer between multiple crypto accounts or some professional agencies.

for github jobs, you may use [terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/search/modules?q=github) since it has some github automation tools
