------

rocm is trash to apu. use vulkan or opengl (alternative backends)

------

find latest build in pytorch nightly repo

use sudo before invoking amdgpu related commands, otherwise unavailable

------

use directml (pytorch, tensorflow) instead. need windows.

you need to set the shared graphical memory to a larger value.

rocm does not work for integrated graphic cards (even if you build it and configured the card name), and supported amd cards are limited.
