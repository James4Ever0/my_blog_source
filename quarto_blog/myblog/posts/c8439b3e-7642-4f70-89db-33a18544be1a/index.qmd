# rectangle related calculation

better make polygon into blocks first (pixelize) and then decompose it into rectangles

[rectirization](https://github.com/shininglion/rectirization) A polygon to rectangle conversion tool, written in cpp

[extractrect](https://github.com/pogam/ExtractRect) find the largest rectangle inscribed in a non-convex polygon

[decompose rectlinear polygon](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/rectangle-decomposition) in nodejs
