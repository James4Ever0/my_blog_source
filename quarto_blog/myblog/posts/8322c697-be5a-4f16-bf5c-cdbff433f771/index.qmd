------

# reset windows server password

`chntpw` does not work this time. it will auto restore 
the SAM file.

instead, under directory `C:\Windows\System32`, swap `Utilman.exe` (remember to back it up) with `cmd.exe` then click widgets in login window to popup command prompt, type `net user <username> <password>` to reset.
