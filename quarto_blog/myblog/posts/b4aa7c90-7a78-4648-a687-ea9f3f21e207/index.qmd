------
```bash
cd /media/root/parrot
cp -R -P /media/root/help1/pyjom .
```
because of the qqChatBot task, pyjom on kali may be syncing too often. need to check the watchdog logs.
turned out it is the `__pycache__` dirs to be blamed
disable all sync related services on macos for debug:
main issue happens after local vscode launched.
the issue is such that the proxy setting not right.
to debug the service:
```bash
sudo launchctl debug gui/501/pyjom_local_syncdog --stdout --stderr
```
```bash
# to be succint:
launchctl list | grep syncdog | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -I abc kill -s TERM abc
# instead of:
#launchctl list | grep pyjom_local_syncdog # to get process pid
#kill -s TERM <service_pid>
```
we need to add some code for it. consider adding something alike to that to kali?
```python
os.environ["http_proxy"]="http://localhost:7930"
os.environ["https_proxy"]="http://localhost:7930"
```
```bash
launchctl stop gui/501/pyjom_local_watchdog;
launchctl kill TERM gui/501/pyjom_local_watchdog;
launchctl unload gui/501/pyjom_local_watchdog;
launchctl disable gui/501/pyjom_local_watchdog;
launchctl remove gui/501/pyjom_local_watchdog;
launchctl stop gui/501/pyjom_local_syncdog;
launchctl kill TERM gui/501/pyjom_local_syncdog;
launchctl unload gui/501/pyjom_local_syncdog;
launchctl disable gui/501/pyjom_local_syncdog;
launchctl remove gui/501/pyjom_local_syncdog
```
install macos pyjom watchdog (local):
```bash
easyd -l pyjom_local_watchdog -w /Users/jamesbrown/Desktop/works/sync_git_repos -- /usr/bin/python3 /Users/jamesbrown/Desktop/works/sync_git_repos/watchdog_macos.py
```
install macos pyjom syncdog (local):
```bash
easyd -l pyjom_local_syncdog -w /Users/jamesbrown/Desktop/works/sync_git_repos -- /usr/bin/python3 /Users/jamesbrown/Desktop/works/sync_git_repos/syncdog_macos.py
```
