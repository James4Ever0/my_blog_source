------

# dash api docset reference search

on non-macos platforms, use zeal instead.

the core problem is that after uninstallation of xcode, one cannot launch the `Apple Doc Helper` or some binary afterwards inside the Apple docset under dash documentation folder. the docset can be copied to this folder automatically by dash but without xcode it cannot be opened.
