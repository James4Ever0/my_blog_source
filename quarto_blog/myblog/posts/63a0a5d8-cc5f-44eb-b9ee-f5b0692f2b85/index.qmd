------
## setup tty
i don't think this will work on android, but let's see?
```bash
ttyd -p <port> -c <username>:<password> <shell_path>
# don't specify interface since that will screw things up
```
## setup x11vnc and novnc
notice novnc has clipboard function now. share clipboard content across devices via the sidebar menu,
in reference of [kali official](https://kali.org/general-use/novnc-kali-in-browser)
x11vnc is mirroring the current x11 session. i set it without password.
```bash
#retrieved from fish history
x11vnc -threads -forever
```
then launch novnc server
```bash
novnc  --vnc localhost:5900 --listen 10020
```
use this url to access from chromebook:
```
http://<kali_ip>:10020/vnc.html?host=<kali_ip>&port=10020
```
