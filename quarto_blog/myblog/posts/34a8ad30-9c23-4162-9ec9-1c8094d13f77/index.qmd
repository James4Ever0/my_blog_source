------

say if you only have one such proxy on localhost, not exposed on router: `localhost:8981`

you execute the command, using [proxy.py](https://pypi.org/project/proxy.py/):

```bash
proxy --port <public_proxy_port> --host <public_proxy_ip_address> \
--plugins proxy.plugin.ProxyPoolPlugin \
--proxy-pool localhost:8981

```
